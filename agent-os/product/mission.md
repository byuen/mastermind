## The Problem

### Lack of Accessible Digital Mastermind Experience
Physical Mastermind games require purchasing a physical product and having a playing partner available. Many digital versions lack intuitive interfaces, proper feedback systems, or difficulty customization. Puzzle enthusiasts need a polished, accessible digital version that offers the authentic Mastermind experience with modern UX improvements.

**Our Solution:** A web-based Mastermind game with an intuitive interface, intelligent AI opponent, multiple difficulty levels, and engaging visual feedback that makes the classic game accessible to everyone.

## Differentiators

Unlike many basic browser implementations, we provide a polished experience with smooth animations, clear visual feedback, and intuitive controls. This results in an enjoyable experience that feels both classic and modern.

### Intelligent Difficulty Scaling
Unlike fixed-difficulty implementations, we offer multiple AI difficulty levels and customizable game parameters (code length, color count, attempt limits). This results in appropriate challenges for players at every skill level.

### Engaging Visual Feedback
Unlike text-based or minimal feedback systems, we provide clear, immediate visual indicators showing correct positions and correct colors in wrong positions. This results in players quickly understanding their progress and making strategic adjustments.
